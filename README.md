This is my team's product, Last Word. Built for the [Stupid Hack 2020](https://app.hackjunction.com/events/stupidhack2020).

**Everyone will die.** At some point.
We never know exactly when we will die and how. 
Yet, we go skydiving, parachuting, drinking filtered coffee..

2 people die every two seconds somewhere on Earth.
And so many die without saying their **last word**. 

Our Last Word app solves that problem! 
Before you do something dangerous, write a message in the Last Word app.
We will share the message all across your social media in 3 days if you do meet your tragic end.

Didn't die? Not a problem! 
You can cancel the posting of your last words, and we will give you a reward for survival and a discount from the insurance company.

## Getting Started

Install all dependencies with
```
npm install
```
