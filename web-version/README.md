# Stupid Hack 2020

This is our team's product, Last Word.

**Everyone will die.** At some point.
We never know exactly when we will die and how. 
Yet, we go to jump with parachute, cook with gas, drink filtered coffee..

Every second almost 2 people die somewhere on Earth.
And so many die without saying their **last word**. 

Last Word App solves that problem! 
Before you do something extreme, write a message in the Last Word.
We will share the message all across your social media in 3 days.

Didn't die? Not a problem! 
If you cancel the posting of your last word, we will give you a reward for survival and a discount from insurance company.
